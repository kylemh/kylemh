# Hello World

Howdy, my name is Kyle! I use he/him/his pronouns. I'm gonna use this space to tell you a bit about me that my resume
doesn't already say.

Here's a fun-fact: I'm still hoping that <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/snowfall-51411702">"Snowfall" journalistic web design</a> becomes a more popular concept. If I'm not coding or watching a concert, you will likely find me eternally suffering as a fan of <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/">Arsenal Football Club</a> or eating Taco Bell (or "Taco Bae" as I so fondly refer to it). I'm one class away from earning my degree at the University of Oregon with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration - and it will probably stay that way üôÉ

## Open Source TODO

This is as much for me as it is you üòÇ

- ‚öõÔ∏è &nbsp; I have a lot of work that I want to deliver on [TSDX](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx), especially in regards to adding [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/) to the mix, but I'm waiting until Storybook's [v6 releases](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/9311).
- üéñ &nbsp; We're doing a lot of work in [Operation Code](https://github.com/OperationCode) to ditch our internal authentication system in favor of leveraging Slack OAuth.
- üñç &nbsp; I want to migrate all of Operation Code's stories to [CSF](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/) and use the stories in test code.
- üê∞ &nbsp; I want to eventually (5 years or so maybe) build out [Innocuous Tech](https://github.com/innocuous-tech) as a digital agency... so I own http://innocuous.tech but need to build a website for it.
- üß± &nbsp; I'd like to fully flesh out [Reach](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui)-esque component library devoid of styles, but focused on a nice API layer + accessibility in [Innoucuous Tech's Core repo](https://github.com/innocuous-tech/core)
- üßê &nbsp; I want to get [Lintground](https://github.com/innocuous-tech/lintground) up and running. It's going to be an app to help teams or individual people come up with a lint config that they enjoy instead of blindly leveraging presets which lead to lint exhaustion. Linting is good, and I'm hoping this app helps convince the world of naysayers that believe it's just a bad formatting tool.

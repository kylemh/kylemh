# Hello World

Howdy, my name is Kyle! I use he/him/his pronouns. I'm gonna use this space to tell you a bit about me that my resume
doesn't already say.

I'm still hoping that <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/snowfall-51411702">"Snowfall" journalistic web design</a> becomes a more popular concept. If I'm not coding or watching a concert, you will likely find me eternally suffering as a fan of <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/">Arsenal Football Club</a> or eating Taco Bell (or "Taco Bae" as I so fondly refer to it). I'm one class away from earning my degree at the University of Oregon with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration - and it will probably stay that way 🙃. In my spare time, I like to play various shooter games, Rocket League, and soccer.
